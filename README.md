The code is used to prepare the images needed for a face mask detection system. It loads the photos from the folders corresponding to the three classes: with mask, without mask, and mask worn incorrectly. Each image is resized and preprocessed so that it can be used by the model. The code automatically assigns each image the label of the class it belongs to. Finally, this dataset is used to train a model that correctly classifies the presence or absence of a mask.
